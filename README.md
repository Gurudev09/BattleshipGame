The Battleship game is a two-player strategy game implemented in Java, 
focusing on object-oriented programming. Players deploy ships on a grid 
and take turns guessing coordinates to sink their opponent's ships. 
OOP concepts like classes, encapsulation, and methods are used to design 
a structured and interactive gameplay experience. 
The game board is represented using a 2D array 
to track ship placements and hits/misses.
The game continues until one player sinks all the opponent's ships, 
showcasing your ability to create an enjoyable and scalable game application.
